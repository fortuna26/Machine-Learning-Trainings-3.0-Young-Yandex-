# Machine Learning Trainings 3.0 Young && Yandex

This repository contains some my projects (home works) from [Machine Learning Trainings 3.0] (https://yandex.ru/yaintern/training/ml-training), which focused on Computer Vision.
Most of implementations leverage the PyTorch framework, covering topics such as CNNs, edge detection (Sobel), local image descriptors (SIFT), panorama stitching (feature matching, homography estimation), techniques to combat neural network overfitting (dropout, regularization, data augmentation).
